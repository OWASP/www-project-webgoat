## Learn the hack - Stop the attack

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to test vulnerabilities 
commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open source components.

## Description 

Web application security is difficult to learn and practice. Not many people have full blown web applications like online book stores or online banks that can be used to scan for vulnerabilities. In addition, security professionals frequently need to test tools against a platform known to be vulnerable to ensure that they perform as advertised. All of this needs to happen in a safe and legal environment.

Even if your intentions are good, we believe you should never attempt to find vulnerabilities without permission. The primary goal of the WebGoat project is simple: create a de-facto interactive teaching environment for web application security. In the future, the project team hopes to extend WebGoat into becoming a security benchmarking platform and a Java-based Web site Honeypot.

**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.*  WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.

**WARNING 2:** *This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.*
